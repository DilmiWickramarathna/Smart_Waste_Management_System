**Problem Statement**

According to Stockholm Vatten och Avfall, garbage collection in Stockholm operates on weekly or biweekly schedules with predefined routes. However, static schedules fail to adapt to real-time waste levels, leading to overflowing bins, unsanitary conditions, and public dissatisfaction. Inefficient routes increase fuel costs, operational expenses, and carbon emissions. A dynamic, data-driven approach is needed to optimize waste collection and address these challenges effectively.

**Proposed Solutions**

The proposed solution involves using IoT sensors to hourly monitor waste levels, integrating cloud data storage and processing, utilizing route optimization algorithms to dynamically adjust collection schedules based on real-time waste level conditions, and applying data analytics and improve waste management policies for more efficient operations and reduced environmental impactâ€‹.

**Target Audience**

Target audiences are municipalities and waste management authorities

**Outline**

A fully functional prototype, featuring a real-time monitoring system that tracks waste levels via a user-friendly app dashboard, providing optimized collection routes displayed on a driver-friendly interface to streamline the collection process.
